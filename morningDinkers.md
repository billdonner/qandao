#  MorningDinkers

MorningDinkers is a loose federation of pickleball enthusiasts and Lifetime Sports at Old Orchard, We are committed to playing enthusiastic but friendly weekday games between 7 and 10 am. There's nothing going on at any other time or place including weekends and/or other courts.

## Membership

- Membership is limited and by invitation only. Everyone "on the list" is already in the group. Adding new members is by consensus only as space and slots are limited.
- Members are expected to show up to matches on time and in good spirits. If unable to play a reasonable player can be substituted instead.

## Administration

A few roles are required to get this going fluidly: Bookers, who make reservations; Players, who are members who want to play at particular times; and Coordinators who are Bookers that match players with reservations to make actual game assignments for MorningDinkers.

### Coordinators

The Coordinators are solely responsible for scheduling players and games.  It is two week job and will rotate between all capable members. For example if MorningDinkers has eight capable members then each member will be a coordinator for two weeks every two months. There are always two active coordinators:

#### Week 1 Coordinator Responsibilities

- remind Bookers to book the evening before
- work with Bookers to ensure enough reservations are made to cover member needs,encourages bookers to "touch up" the reservation schedule as necessary 
- work with Members to ensure their collective playing requirments are met
- perform the booking algorithm and publish player schedule for week 2 towards end of week 1 

#### Week 2 Coordinator Responsibilities

- handle last minute and emergency adjustments
- inform Bookers of any necessary court cancellations
- remind Members the evening before to show up to play games as scheduled


### Bookers

The Bookers, as a group, must be Lifetime Signature Members to allow reservations in advance at not charge. All MorningDinkers with Signature Membership privileges are expected to make reservations for the benefit of the group from time to time, or frequently, as required by the group:

- Under the current Lifetime Rules, bookings should be made at 9am and 8 days in advance of the playing date. Bookers should initially try for a 90 minute slot.
- To book a court for two hours requires two Signature members. To book three courts will require six members. In some instances we may not be able to book two hours.
- A Booker must show up to play for all bookings. It is not acceptable to Lifetime to reserve a court and not check in at the front desk beforehand. It may be possible for a Coordinator to juggle a reservation from one signature member to another at the last minute.

#### Cancellation of Bookings

It's bad form and morally unacceptable to make uneeded bookings. Occassionally the Coordinator will advise a booker that a particular reservation is uneeded and should be cancelled.

- Cancellation can be done in the app prior to 24 hours before the reservation.
- Cancellation can be  done at the front desk within 24 hours. 

#### Unavailabilty of Bookings

Ocassionally, we may not be able to book as many reservations as the MorningDinkers require. In this case the Coordinator will need to advise members and if necessary suggest that some games will need to move to Vernon Hills.
